## Deployment Details

Unfortunately, our website has been flagged as harmful by Google due to the absence of custom purchased domains and security measures. This is because we launched the website through a free subdomain obtained via Infinity Free. We acknowledge this limitation and encourage users to exercise caution when accessing the site.

## Project Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort, successfully completed by a dedicated team. Our ability and mindset to work together allowed us to overcome challenges and deliver a fully functional online platform.
